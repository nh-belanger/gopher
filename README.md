Welcome to Gopher! This was my final project, or "breakable toy" for Launch Academy.

Designed to bring country club's into the 21st century, Gopher allows members to publish their teetimes and dining reservations. Other members can view these, and request to join. Uses the darksky weather api to pull current forecasts and predictions.

NB: This app is still very much "in development". As such, I _highly_ recommend viewing it in Chrome. Catch the latest version [here](http://gophergolf.herokuapp.com)
